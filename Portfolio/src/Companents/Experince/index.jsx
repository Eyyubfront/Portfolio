            I would like to share this experience with you. After completing the 5 month course, I decided to join the front-end developer internship program offered by the course. Here I wanted to show my passion and interest in this field by developing myself by developing real projects with html5 and css3. Most importantly, it helped me increase my experience, which was very important to me. I also increased my experience by participating in a hackathon competition. I began to actively work in a team to apply what I learned. I am very happy to see results in these efforts that I continue to do my best and it strengthens my passion in this field even more.
